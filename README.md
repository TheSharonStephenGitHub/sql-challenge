# sql-challenge
 
I first started this homework by importing the csv files into postgre, by initializing the tables and then using the query tool to process the data.

Then, I created the sql entity relationship diagram by using the website link, and figuring out the PK and FK of the data.

Then, for the query's was pretty simple. I just SELECCT, FROM, WHERE AND ORDER BY to navigate and clean the data according to the required questions.

The results excel sheets contain all the data for each of the questions as a reference.
